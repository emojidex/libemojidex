libemojidex
===========
emojidex libraries in C++. 
Built with portability in mind this library should easily enable back-end integration on desktop, 
server and mobile platforms.

Building
========

1. Install dependencies (cmake, boost system, boost filesystem, SSL development packages/headers)
2. Get submodules with:
  ```
  git submodule update --init --recursive"
  ```
3. Create the build directory, eg:
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
4. Run cmake:  
  ```
  cmake ..
  ```
5. Build with "make" on \*nix or import into your IDE and build.
6. Simply link against the compiled library to use libemojidex.

Java Native Interface
---------------------

1. Follow steps 1 - 3 from normal build.
